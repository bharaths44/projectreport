\chapter{DESIGN AND MODELING}

Design and modeling are essential phases in the software development lifecycle, playing a
crucial role in the creation of effective and wellstructured systems. These phases involve
the conceptualization, planning, and representation of a software solution before its actual
implementation.
\section{Activity Diagram}
An activity diagram is a type of UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagram that visually represents the flow of activities in a system or business process. It is commonly used in software development to illustrate the dynamic aspects of a system and describe how different activities or tasks interact with each other. Activity diagrams are particularly useful for modeling the workflow within a system and for understanding the sequence of actions that take place.

\subsection{Key elements of Activity Diagrams}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Activity:} Represented by rounded rectangles, activities are the specific tasks or actions that are performed within the system. These can range from simple operations to complex processes.
    \item \textbf{Transitions:} Arrows connecting activities indicate the flow or transition from one activity to another. The direction of the arrow shows the order of execution.
    \item \textbf{Decision Nodes:} Diamonds are used to represent decision points in the workflow. Depending on certain conditions, the process may take different paths.
    \item \textbf{Fork and Join Nodes:} Fork nodes (split) and join nodes (merge) show parallel or concurrent activities. Forks represent the divergence of multiple flows, while joins represent their convergence.
    \item \textbf{Initial and Final Nodes:} Circles are used to denote the start (initial node) and end (final node) of the activity diagram. The initial node represents the beginning of the process, and the final node indicates the conclusion.
\end{itemize}

\noindent Figure 4.1 illustrates the activity diagram for the ASTRO Platform, showcasing the sequence of activities performed by suppliers, vendors, and admins. This diagram provides a high-level overview of the key entities and components involved in the system, detailing their interactions and responsibilities throughout the order processing and delivery process.

\subsection{Key Entities and Components}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Supplier Activities}
          \begin{enumerate}
              \item \textbf{Login to System:} The supplier logs into the system to access functionalities for managing products and tracking orders.
              \item \textbf{Manage Products (Add/Update Items):} Suppliers add or update product listings to ensure the catalog is up-to-date and accurate.
              \item \textbf{Add Minimum Order Quantity:} Suppliers set a minimum order quantity for each product, preventing inefficient processing of very small orders.
              \item \textbf{View Orders Placed by Vendors:} Suppliers can view pending orders from vendors, preparing them for order fulfillment.
              \item \textbf{Confirm Vendor Orders:} Suppliers review and confirm vendor orders, moving them to the fulfillment phase.

              \item \textbf{Quantity Check (Yes/No):}
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item \textbf{If Quantity Meets Minimum Requirement:} The order is confirmed directly.
                        \item \textbf{If Quantity Is Below Minimum Requirement:}
                              \begin{enumerate}
                                  \item \textbf{Use Neural Prophet Model:} The system uses a Neural Prophet model to forecast demand and determine if combining orders with other vendors can reach the minimum order threshold.
                                  \item \textbf{Notify Other Vendors:} Other vendors are notified to consider joining a joint order.
                                  \item \textbf{Joint Order Confirmation Check (Yes/No):}
                                        \begin{itemize}
                                            \item \textbf{If Other Vendors Agree:} The joint order is confirmed.
                                            \item \textbf{If Not:} The vendor proceeds with an individual order.
                                        \end{itemize}
                                  \item \textbf{Initiate Genetic Algorithm for Order Aggregation:} The system uses a genetic algorithm to identify the best vendor combinations for the joint order.
                                  \item \textbf{Evaluate Vendor Combinations:} Different combinations are assessed to find an optimal one that meets requirements.
                                  \item \textbf{Select Optimal Vendor Combination:} The system selects the optimal vendor combination, and a joint order confirmation is received.
                                  \item \textbf{Receive Final Confirmation:} Vendors receive the final confirmation, including billing details and delivery date.
                              \end{enumerate}
                    \end{itemize}
          \end{enumerate}

    \item \textbf{Admin Activities}
          \begin{enumerate}
              \item \textbf{Log into System:} The admin logs into the system to monitor and analyze overall processes.
              \item \textbf{Monitor Number of Orders:} Admin tracks order volumes, gaining insights into demand trends and operational load.
              \item \textbf{Analyze Prophet Models:} Admin reviews the performance of demand forecasting models, such as Neural Prophet, to ensure accurate predictions and make adjustments if necessary.
              \item \textbf{View System's Overall Process:} Admin has a top-down view of system activities to ensure smooth operations and identify areas for improvement.
          \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}


Hereâ€™s how activity diagrams can be specifically helpful in this context:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Enhanced Clarity of Process Flow: The diagram visually represents the process, making it easier for stakeholders to understand each role's responsibilities and interactions. By defining the steps each role follows, the diagram ensures that all parties (Suppliers, Vendors, and Admins) understand their tasks and when each task needs to be completed.
    \item Identification of Key Decision Points: The activity diagram highlights critical decision points, such as the quantity check for minimum orders. This helps in identifying points where conditional logic and alternative flows come into play, ensuring that the system can handle various scenarios efficiently. For example, if the order quantity is insufficient, the system automatically checks for joint orders, thus streamlining the process without manual intervention.
    \item Improved Coordination Between Roles: By detailing the interactions between suppliers, vendors, and admins, the diagram promotes better coordination. Vendors can initiate joint orders when quantities are low, and suppliers can confirm orders and optimize delivery routes accordingly. This collaboration ensures that orders are fulfilled more efficiently and that each role's activities are synchronized.
    \item Guidance for System Design and Development: For developers, the activity diagram serves as a blueprint for creating system modules. Each activity can be mapped to specific features in the system, like order confirmation, joint order aggregation, route optimization, and demand forecasting using the Neural Prophet model. This structured approach helps in modular and organized system development, making the codebase easier to manage and maintain.
\end{itemize}
\section{Sequence Diagram}

A sequence diagram is a type of UML (Unified Modeling Language) diagram that illustrates the interactions between different components or actors in a system over time. It presents a chronological sequence of messages or actions between the various entities, providing a visual representation of the dynamic behavior of the system.
\subsection{Key elements of Sequence Diagrams}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Actors and Objects:} Represent the entities (users, systems, or objects) involved in the interactions.
    \item \textbf{Lifelines:} Vertical lines extending from actors or objects, showing their presence over time in the sequence.
    \item \textbf{Messages:} Arrows that represent the communication between lifelines, including method calls, data exchanges, and responses.
    \item \textbf{Activation Bars:} Narrow rectangles on lifelines indicating when an object is actively performing a task.
    \item \textbf{Control Structures:} Elements like loops, conditions, and alternative frames (alt/opt frames) that model conditional, repeated, or optional interactions.
    \item \textbf{Destruction:} Marked by an "X" at the end of a lifeline, indicating the termination of an object in the sequence.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Purpose of Sequence Diagrams}
\begin{itemize}
    \item {Understanding System Behavior:} Sequence diagrams help in understanding how different components or actors in a system interact with each other over time, depicting the flow of control and communication.
    \item {Communication:} They serve as a communication tool among stakeholders, including developers, designers, and project managers, by offering a clear and visual representation of system interactions.
    \item {Design and Analysis:} Sequence diagrams aid in the design and analysis phases of software development, helping to identify potential issues in the systemâ€™s logic or communication flow.
    \item {Visualizing the Workflow:} It provides a clear and concise overview of the different steps involved in the Alzheimerâ€™s disease detection process.
    \item {Identifying Potential Bottlenecks:} It helps to identify any potential bottlenecks in the system, such as slow preprocessing steps or inaccurate model predictions.
    \item {Facilitating Communication:} It serves as a common language for developers, researchers, and other stakeholders involved in the project.
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}
\noindent Figure 4.2 illustrates the sequence of interactions between the key entities and components of the ASTRO Platform. This diagram provides a step-by-step view of how the system processes an order from initiation to delivery. It shows the flow of messages and the order in which they are exchanged, highlighting the interactions between the Supplier, Vendor, Admin, Order Aggregation System (OAS), Neural Prophet Model, and Logistics Optimization.
\subsection{Key Entities and Components}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Supplier:} Manages product inventory and fulfills confirmed orders.
    \item \textbf{Vendor:} Places orders for products based on the demand forecast and minimum order requirements.
    \item \textbf{Admin:} Monitors the overall process, analyzes model performance, and reviews logistics planning.
    \item \textbf{Order Aggregation System (OAS):} Core system component that manages the flow of order requests, checks conditions, and coordinates with other components.
    \item \textbf{Neural Prophet Model:} A demand forecasting model that helps in predicting demand and evaluating whether joint orders would be beneficial.
    \item \textbf{Logistics Optimization:} Component responsible for optimizing delivery routes and managing the final logistics.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Sequence of Interactions}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Login to System:} The Vendor initiates the sequence by logging into the system to access the product catalog, choose items, and place orders.
    \item \textbf{Select Supplier and Choose Items from Catalog:} The Vendor selects a supplier and items from the catalog, specifying the order quantity.
    \item \textbf{Order Quantity Check:} The Order Aggregation System (OAS) checks whether the order quantity meets the minimum order requirement.
          \begin{itemize}
              \item \textbf{If Order Quantity Meets Minimum Requirement:} The order is processed as a standard, individual order. The vendor confirms the order, and it proceeds to the delivery logistics phase.
              \item \textbf{If Order Quantity Is Below Minimum Requirement:} The OAS initiates steps to evaluate the feasibility of a joint order.
                    \begin{enumerate}
                        \item \textbf{Use Neural Prophet Model for Demand Forecasting:} The Neural Prophet Model is used to forecast demand and determine if combining orders from nearby vendors might help reach the minimum order quantity. This forecast provides data-driven insights into the orderâ€™s potential demand over time.
                        \item \textbf{Notify Nearby Vendors for Joint Order:} If the demand forecast suggests that a joint order is viable, the OAS sends notifications to nearby vendors, inviting them to participate in a joint order.
                        \item \textbf{Nearby Vendors Confirm Joint Order:} Other vendors respond to the joint order request. If they agree, the joint order process moves forward; otherwise, the initial vendor proceeds with an individual order.
                        \item \textbf{Initiate Genetic Algorithm for Order Aggregation:} The OAS employs a Genetic Algorithm to evaluate different combinations of vendors for the joint order, aiming to find an optimal mix that maximizes efficiency and meets the minimum order requirements.
                        \item \textbf{Evaluate Vendor Combinations:} The Genetic Algorithm component iterates through various vendor combinations to find the best possible aggregation. This ensures that the order is cost-effective and meets quantity requirements.
                        \item \textbf{Select Optimal Vendor Combination:} The system selects the optimal vendor combination for the joint order and proceeds to confirmation.
                        \item \textbf{Receive Joint Order Confirmation:} Once an optimal combination is selected, the OAS sends a joint order confirmation to all participating vendors. The joint order is now officially confirmed.
                    \end{enumerate}
          \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Order Processing and Final Confirmation:} For both joint and individual orders, the system notifies vendors of the final confirmation, bill, and delivery date.
    \item \textbf{Optimize Routes for Delivery:} The Logistics Optimization component optimizes delivery routes based on the confirmed orders, minimizing delivery time and cost by consolidating deliveries where possible.
    \item \textbf{Admin Activities:} The Admin monitors system processes and performance. Admin also reviews and analyzes the accuracy of Neural Prophet Model forecasts and evaluates system functionality, using insights to make improvements to the process.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Class Diagram}

A class diagram is a visual blueprint of a system in object-oriented programming, showcasing the classes, their attributes (properties), operations (methods), and the relationships between them. Itâ€™s like a map that reveals the building blocks and their connections, guiding the development and understanding of the system.

\subsection{Key Elements of Class Diagrams}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Classes:} These are the fundamental building blocks, represented as rectangles with the class name inside. Each class encapsulates a specific concept or entity within the system, like "Customer" or "Order."
    \item \textbf{Attributes:} These define the data associated with a class, like "name" and "address" for the "Customer" class. Theyâ€™re listed within the class rectangle, often with data types specified.
    \item \textbf{Operations:} These represent the actions a class can perform, like "placeOrder" or "calculateTotal" for the "Order" class. Theyâ€™re shown as functions within the class rectangle, with their parameters and return values if applicable.
    \item \textbf{Relationships:} These depict the connections between classes, indicating how they interact with each other.
\end{itemize}

\section{Use Case Diagram}
In the Unified Modeling Language (UML), a Use Case Diagram is a sort of behavioral diagram that depicts the interactions between various actors (users or external systems) and a system that is being studied. It offers a high-level perspective on how different entities use the features or functionalities of a system. A use case diagramâ€™s main objective is to represent and illustrate the various ways users engage with a system and the results they receive.
\subsection{Key Elements of Use Case Diagrams}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Use Case:} A use case is an example of a particular functionality or group of related functions that the system offers to its users, also known as actors. Use cases are designated to indicate a particular action or objective and are usually represented as ovals.

    \item \textbf{Actor:} An outside party interacting with the system is called an actor. Actors might be physical devices, other systems, or human actors. Stick figures are used to represent actors, who engage with the system by taking part in one or more use cases.

    \item \textbf{System Boundary:} Depicted as a box, the system boundary establishes the parameters of the system and demarcates its external participants. Actors reside outside the system boundaries, whereas use cases exist inside it.

    \item \textbf{Association:} Associations are shown as lines joining actors to use cases. These lines show that an actor participates in or communicates with a certain use case. Associations serve as a channel of communication between the use case and the actor.

    \item \textbf{Include Relationship:} An include relationship shows that one use case incorporates the functionality of another use case. It is represented by a dashed arrow. It suggests that the behavior of the base use case includes the added use case.

    \item \textbf{Extend Relationship:} An extended connection shows that, under certain circumstances, one use case can extend the behavior of another use case. It is represented by a dashed arrow with an open arrowhead. It suggests that the expanding use case is called upon under particular circumstances and is optional.

\end{itemize}
Some use cases might not include interactions with a particular actor; instead, they might represent system-wide operations or processes. We call these use cases for the system.

\subsection{Value of Use Case Diagrams}

Use Case Diagrams are valuable tools for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Communication:} Use case diagrams offer a visual representation that helps stakeholdersâ€”developers, designers, and non-technical stakeholdersâ€”communicate with one other.
    \item \textbf{Requirements Analysis:} By recognizing and recording user-system interactions, they aid in the elicitation and clarification of system requirements.
    \item \textbf{System Design:} The architecture and user interfaces of the system are designed using use case diagrams as a guide.
    \item \textbf{Testing:} By figuring out scenarios in which users engage with the system, they can be used to generate test cases.
    \item \textbf{Project Planning:} By highlighting important features and their relationships, use case diagrams can help with project planning.
\end{itemize}
